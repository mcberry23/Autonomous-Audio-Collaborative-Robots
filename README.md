# Collaborative-Robots
This project is a for an Autonomous Mobile Robotics class centered around developing collaborative robots using the Pololu Zumo 32u4 platform.  The robots are tasked with simulataneously solving a maze.  The first one to finish will alert the others how to solve the maze from the starting location via a wireless communication link.  The platform used is the Zumo 32u4 outfitted with an HC-12 module.
