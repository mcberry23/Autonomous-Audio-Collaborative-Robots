# Autonomous-Audio-Collaborative-Robots
This project is a for an Autonomous Mobile Robotics class centered around developing collaborative robots using the Pololu Zumo 32u4 platform.  The robots can communicate with audible sound.  Data is transferred using the dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) protocol similar to dial tones used on classical phone systems.
